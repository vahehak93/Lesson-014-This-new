***Task 1***\
 Calculator Constructor

 Create functions for the Calculator class that can do the following:
- Add two numbers.
- Subtract two numbers.
- Multiply two numbers.
- Divide two numbers.
 ```javascript
const calculator = new Calculator();
calculator.add(10, 5);
calculator.subtract(10, 5);
calculator.multiply(10, 5);
calculator.divide(10, 5);
```

***Task 2***\
Person
Create a method in the Person class which returns how another person's age compares. Given the instances p1, p2 and p3, which will be initialised with the attributes
name and age, return a sentence in the following format:
{other person name} is {older than / younger than / the same age as} me.

```javascript
const p1 = Person("Samuel", 24)
const p2 = Person("Joel", 36)
const p3 = Person("Lily", 24)
p1.compareAge(p2) ➞ "Joel is older than me."
p2.compareAge(p1) ➞ "Samuel is younger than me."
p1.compareAge(p3) ➞ "Lily is the same age as me."
```
***Task 3***\
Person Constructor
- Write a Person Constructor that initializes name and age from arguments.
- All instances of Person should initialize with an empty stomach array.
- Give instances of Person the ability to .eat("someFood") :
- When eating an edible, it should be pushed into the stomach .
- The eat method should have no effect if there are 10 items in the stomach .
- Give instances of Person the ability to .poop() :
- When an instance poops, its stomach should empty.
- Give instances of Person a method .toString() :
- It should return a string with name and age . Example: "Mary, 50"

***Task 4***\
Car Constructor

- Write a Car constructor that initializes model and milesPerGallon from arguments.
- All instances built with Car:
should initialize with an tank at 0
should initialize with an odometer at 0
- Give cars the ability to get fueled with a .fill(gallons) method. Add the gallons to tank . - STRETCH: - Give cars ability to .drive(distance) . The
distance driven:
- Should cause the odometer to go up.
- Should cause the the tank to go down taking milesPerGallon into account.
- STRETCH: A car which runs out of fuel while driving can't drive any more distance:

- The drive method should return a string "I ran out of fuel at x miles!" x being odometer .


***Task 5***\
Baby Constructor

- Write a Baby constructor subclassing Person.
- Besides name and age , Baby takes a third argument to initialize favoriteToy .
- Besides the methods on Person.prototype, babies have the ability to .play() :
- Should return a string "Playing with x", x being the favorite toy.

***Task 6***\
Playlist

- Add: Pushes the passed-through song to the songs array
- Play: Plays current song based on array index
- Stop: Holds place in array, but calls above stop song prototype function
- Next: Sets the next song in the songs array, calling the above play prototype function
- Song should take in two arguments, title and artist, which should both be added as properties when the Song constructor function is used.
- Play: Sets the song as playing using isPlaying
- Stop: Sets the song as not playing (isPlaying = false)
```javascript
const playlist = new Playlist();
const heyJude = new Song("Hey Jude", "The Beatles");
const jaded = new Song("Jaded", "Aerosmith");
playlist.add(heyJude);
playlist.add(jaded);
playlist.play(); // Hey Jude started to play
playlist.next(); // Hey Jude stopped, Jaded started
playlist.next(); // Jaded stopped, Hey Jude started
playlist.stop(); // Hey Jude stopped
playlist.play(); // Hey Jude started
```
